  <str key="synchronization_between_computers_title"># Synchronization between computers in the network</str>
  <str key="synchronization_intro">In addition to saving the configuration and importing it, Save Desktop also allows you to synchronize it between computers on your network using a shared cloud folder or a shared Syncthing folder.</str>
  <str key="set_up_first_pc">## Setting Up on the First Computer
1. Open the **Sync** page in the Save Desktop app.
2. Click **“Set up the sync file.”**
3. A quick setup wizard will appear:
   * If you're using GNOME, Cinnamon, Budgie, or older COSMIC, the **GNOME Online Accounts** method is used.
   * For KDE Plasma or other desktops, it switches to **Rclone** (you’ll just need to copy a command and paste it into the terminal).
   * Alternatively, you can use **Syncthing** by clicking **“Use Syncthing’s folder instead”** and selecting a synced folder.
4. After finishing the wizard, the **“Set up the sync file”** dialog will open:
   * A **periodic saving file** (your desktop config archive) will start generating inside the selected folder.
   * You can optionally change the interval or filename using the **“Change”** button.
5. Click **“Apply”**:
   * A second file, `SaveDesktop.json`, is created in the same folder. It contains the sync file name and saving interval.
   * You will be prompted to **log out** of your session so synchronization can fully activate.</str>
  <str key="set_up_second_pc">## Connecting on Another Computer
1. On the other computer, go to the **Sync** page again.
2. Click **“Connect to the cloud storage.”**
3. The same wizard will appear – choose your synced folder via GNOME OA, Rclone, or Syncthing.
4. After the wizard:
   * The **“Connect to the cloud storage”** dialog opens.
   * Select the **sync interval** and enable or disable **Bidirectional synchronization**.
5. Click **“Apply”**:
   * You will be prompted to **log out**, or (if using manual sync) informed that you can sync from the app’s header menu.
   * After logging back in, Save Desktop connects to the shared folder and syncs your configuration automatically, with a notification at the start and end.
</str>
  <str key="bidirectional_sync">### Bidirectional Synchronization
If **Bidirectional synchronization** is enabled on both computers:
* Save Desktop copies sync settings (such as interval and filename) from one machine to the other,
* This keeps your systems in sync without needing to configure each one manually.</str>
  <str key="synchronization_files">## Files Used in Synchronization
* **Periodic saving file** – a `.sd.zip` archive of your desktop configuration, updated regularly.
* **SaveDesktop.json** – a small helper file that stores the archive’s filename and saving interval, used during sync setup.</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_title"># Saving, importing, and syncing Flatpak apps</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_intro">Save Desktop allows you to save, import, and sync Flatpak applications together with their user data, in addition to icons, themes, settings, and extensions.</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_dest">## Where can I find this?

Flatpak-related options are located in the **Select configuration items** dialog.
You can open it from the header menu (three dots in the window title bar).</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_options">## Available options

### List of installed Flatpak apps

Saves and restores the list of installed Flatpak applications.

### User data of installed Flatpak apps

Allows you to include user data of selected Flatpak applications.
Click the **"&gt;"** button to choose which apps should have their data saved.

### Keep installed Flatpak apps and data (enabled by default)

When enabled, Save Desktop **will NOT remove Flatpak applications or their data that are not present in the archive**.

When disabled, Save Desktop will **remove any installed Flatpak apps that are not listed in the imported archive — including their user data**.

⚠️ **Warning:**
Disable this option only if you intentionally want your system to exactly match the imported archive. Removed applications and their data **cannot be recovered**.</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_import_process">## How does importing work?

After selecting an archive or folder, you will be asked which configuration items should be imported.
Click **Apply** to start the import process.

Import order:

1. Desktop configuration (icons, themes, fonts, extensions, settings, etc.)
2. Flatpak applications and their user data (after next login)

Flatpak installation and removal start **after you log back into the system**.</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_sync_mode">### Synchronization mode

In synchronization mode, Flatpak applications are processed **immediately after synchronization finishes** (no relog required).</str>
  <str key="flatpak_wiki_note">## Important note

If **Keep installed Flatpak apps and data** is disabled and you have Flatpak applications installed that are not included in the imported archive, they will be **permanently removed together with their user data**.</str>
