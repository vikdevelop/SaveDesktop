# Contributing to the Save Desktop app
First, thanks for your interest in the contribution to this app, I appreciate it!

There are a couple of ways to contribute to Save Desktop:

## Translations
Thanks to the community, Save Desktop is translated into more than 20 languages. However, if your language is not available in the app or if your language in the app is not complete, feel free to add or edit it using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/vikdevelop/savedesktop/)!

It's also possible to translate the application wiki [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/vikdevelop/savedesktop-github-wiki/)

To add or modify an existing language, you must be registered for Weblate, which can be done via email, a Github or Google account, and many other services.

## Involvement in development
Save Desktop is written in Python 3 using [GTK 4.0](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) and [LibAdwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/index.html) libraries, so if you have knowledge of Python and, ideally, in combination with these libraries, your contributions are welcome!
If you don't know how to contribute specifically, you can check out the [issues marked as “good first issue”](https://github.com/vikdevelop/SaveDesktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

No Python knowledge? Never mind. For example, you can contribute to the [application wiki](https://github.com/vikdevelop/SaveDesktop/tree/webpage/wiki) (e.g. improve webpage style)

*It should be noted that this app is available under the [GNU GPL 3.0](https://github.com/vikdevelop/SaveDesktop/blob/main/LICENSE) license, so it is necessary to follow the license conditions.*

## Reporting issues
Have you found a bug in the app? Do you have a suggestion for a new feature, or is something not clear? You can use [Github issues](https://github.com/vikdevelop/SaveDesktop/issues) for this purpose, but make sure someone else hasn't reported a similar issue before you. Don't prefer Github issues? If so, you can use [this form](https://vikdevelop.github.io/SaveDesktop/open-issue/) or [Github discussions](https://github.com/vikdevelop/SaveDesktop/discussions).

**I look forward to your contributions to this app!**
