# Security Policy
### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability, please **don't open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately to the maintainer via one of the following methods:
- GitHub Security Advisory: use the _Security_ tab
- Email: vikdevelop@proton.me

### Distribution
The application is officially distributed through **Flathub** and the **Snap Store**, both with automatic updates.

Unofficial, community-maintained packages may also exist for other platforms or distributions (e.g. AUR, PPAs, third-party repositories). 

Please note that these builds are **not officially supported** by the maintainer.

- **Security vulnerabilities in the application itself** should always be reported directly to the maintainer (see above).  
- **Issues related to unofficial packages** (e.g. build errors, missing dependencies, outdated versions) should be reported to the respective package maintainer.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure by reporting issues responsibly!
